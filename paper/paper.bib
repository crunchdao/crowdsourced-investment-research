abstract={Traditionally, the development of investment strategies has required domain-specific knowledge and access to restricted datasets. 
Hence, the majority of data scientists do not research investment opportunities because they lack one or both of these requirements. 
In this article, the authors discuss the merits of tournaments as a crowdsourcing paradigm for investment research. 
Tournaments can overcome these research barriers, hence enabling the wide population of data scientists to contribute to the development 
of investment strategies.  TOPICS:Simulations, big data/machine learning  Key Findings  • There are several barriers to the development of 
investment strategies: domain-specific knowledge barrier, budgetary constraints and confidentiality restrictions, inability to monetize the 
value of data, and backtest overfitting.  • Tournaments offer a solution for overcoming the barriers associated with developing investment 
strategies.  • The modern investment process the authors suggest allows data scientists without an investment background to contribute 
forecasts to a systematic asset manager.  • This does not mean that tournaments obviate the need for financial expertise. 
On the contrary, deep financial expertise is required to cast the problem crowdsourced through the tournament.}}

Numerai proposes Numeraire, a new cryptographic token that can be used in a novel auction mechanism to make overfitting economically irrational. The auction mechanism leads to equilibrium bidding behavior that reveals rational data scientists’ confidence in their models’ ability to perform well on new data. The auction mechanism also yields natural arguments for the economic value of a Numeraire token.}}

Today ML algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this is the most exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that will transform how everyone invests for generations. Readers will learn how to structure Big data in a way that is amenable to ML algorithms; how to conduct research with ML algorithms on that data; how to use supercomputing methods; how to backtest your discoveries while avoiding false positives. The book addresses real-life problems faced by practitioners on a daily basis, and explains scientifically sound solutions using math, supported by code and examples. Readers become active users who can test the proposed solutions in their particular setting. Written by a recognized expert and portfolio manager, this book will equip investment professionals with the groundbreaking tools needed to succeed in modern finance.}}

However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users’ privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system.}}

We present a method for portfolio optimization based on replacing expected returns with ordering information, that is, with information about the order of the expected returns. We give a simple and economically rational definition of optimal portfolios that extends Markowitz' meanvariance optimality condition in a natural way; in particular, our construction allows full use of covariance information. We also provide efficient numerical algorithms. The formulation we develop is very general and is easily extended to a variety of cases, for example, where assets are divided into multiple sectors or there are multiple sorting criteria available.}}

The model is a mixed integer quadratic programming problem which arises when Markowitz’ classical mean–variance model is enriched with additional realistic constraints. Exact optimization algorithms run into difficulties in this framework and this motivates the investigation of heuristic techniques. Computational experiments indicate that the approach is promising for this class of problems.}}

Exploramos un enfoque alternativo (HPCA) que hace un fuerte uso de la particion del mercado en sectores. Demostramos que este enfoque no conduce a la perdida de informacion con respecto al PCA en el caso de la renta variable (constituidos por el S&P 500) y tambien que los factores comunes asociados admiten interpretaciones simples. El modelo tambien se puede utilizar en mercados en los que los sectores tienen informacion asincronica de precios, como single-name swaps de incumplimiento de credito, generalizando las obras de Cont y Kan (2011) e Ivanov (2016).}}

@ARTICLE{Akansu_2021,title={Quant investing in cluster portfolios},year={2021},author={Ali N. Akansu and Marco Avellaneda and Anqi Xiong},doi={10.21314/jois.2021.006},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={3157262121},journal={Journal of Interaction Science},abstract={This paper discusses portfolio construction for investing in N given assets, eg, constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or large cap stocks, based on partitioning the investment universe into clusters. The clusters are determined from the trailing correlation matrix via an information theoretic algorithm that uses thresholding of high-correlation pairs. We calculate the principal eigenvector of each cluster from its correlation matrix and the corresponding eigenportfolio. The cluster portfolios are combined into a single N-asset portfolio based on a weighting scheme for the clusters. Various tests conducted on components of the DJIA and a 30-stock basket of large cap stocks indicate that the new portfolios are superior to the DJIA and other mean–variance portfolios in terms of their risk-adjusted returns from 2009 to 2019. We also tested the cluster portfolios for a larger basket of 373 Standard & Poor’s 500 components from 2001 to 2019. The test results provide convincing evidence that a cluster-based portfolio can outperform passive investing.}}
